# democlojure

This is a simple console application for creating and storing ring tones 
written in Clojure. This is actually a simulation of the console app(like in terminal or cmd). 
It's called democlojure(for a lack of a better name)
because it's my first Clojure application and it was my first Clojure assignment for school.

The further development of this application is stopped except for maybe
some minor adjustments.

## Usage
